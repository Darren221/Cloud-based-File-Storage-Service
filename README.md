# Cloud-based-File-Storage-Service

A cloud-based file storage service based on Dropbox. In this project, a networked file storage application is implemented that lets you sync files to and from the "cloud". With this program, multiple clients can concurrently connect to the service to access a common, shared set of files. Clients accessing this service will see a consistent set of updates to files, ensuring a reliable and up-to-date user experience. Through this project, the goal is to create a robust and efficient cloud-based file storage service that can be used for a variety of applications.
